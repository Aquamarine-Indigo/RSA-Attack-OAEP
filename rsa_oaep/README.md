## Implementing RSA-OAEP

The file ``RSA_OAEP.hpp`` is the main file.

To run the encryption and decryption, you can run ``run_all.sh``. The shell uses the RSA key pair in the ``/rsa/rsa_key`` folder, and the raw message is generated by ``gen_plaintext.cpp``. Correlated files are in the folder ``rsa_encryption``.
