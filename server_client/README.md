Use ``run_server.sh`` to compile and run the server.

Use ``run_client.sh`` to compile and run the client.

After running the server and client, you can tap enter in the client to send a WUP request message to the server. WUP messages will be recorded in the server's history file. The history is in ``history/server_history.txt``.
